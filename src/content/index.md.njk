# Metalsmith Bare-bone Starter
Metalsmith is an extremely simple, pluggable static site generator. This Metalsmith starter website is intended to help you to get started with building a static site with Metalsmith. It uses Markdown to write content and the Nubnjucks tem,plating language to build the final page.

The rest is left to your imagination.

## Why is Metalsmith simple?
When all manipulations are performed by plugins, the only thing Metalsmith has to do in its core is to provide for an underlying logic of actually how manipulations are dealt with and for a defined interface for the plugins. To achieve this, we only needed around 400 lines of code â€” [have a look at the source yourself](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith/blob/master/lib/index.js). We believe this is rather simple.

For manipulations Metalsmith uses a very clever, but extremely simple idea. All source files are initially converted into JavaScript objects with the usual `{property: property value}` pairs. These `{property: property value}` pairs contain information on the original file itself (such as its `birthtime` or `path`) and on its content. The JavaScript object for each file is then supplemented with all variables either specified in the front-matter of the file or elsewhere. The manipulations performed by the plugins are now nothing else then modifications applied to the JavaScript objects either by changing the properties or the property values.

Breaking down Metalsmith into a core and many plugins has several advantages. It reduces complexity. It gives the user the freedom to use exactly only those plugins he or she needs. Furthermore, it distributes the honor and the burden of maintaining the Metalsmith core and its plugins onto the Metalsmith community. With this approach we hope to keep the Metalsmith environment pretty up-to-date.

Writing plugins itself is also rather simple. The plugin-interface is easy to understand and most plugins are also rather short.

Every site needs JavaScript anyway. Just like the popular task runners gulp or grunt Metalsmith is programmed in JavaScript. So, you do not have to rely on a further language such as Ruby, Python or Go. This also helps to keep your workflow simple.
