This Metalsmith starter website is intended to help you to get started with building a blog site with Metalsmith. It uses Markdown to write content and the Nunjucks templating language to build pages.

The site is an extension of the [Metalsmith bare-bones starter](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-bare-bones-starter) with the addition of the blog landing page and several greek blogposts.

The rest is left to your imagination.
